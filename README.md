# DevOps-Learning-
Here I will document my DevOps learning journey

My first commit comprised of a basic math function, this function allows the user to input 2 numbers. Addition, subtraction and divison are performed using these numbers.
In the division section I added an if statement that checked to see if the denominator was zero and if so the command did not run.
